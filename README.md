This is the work done for the module of upgradable smart contracts.
It has been with the help of openzeppelin contracts.
Installed v5.x instead of 4.8.3 as the makefile of Patrick was taken over, reported and solved btw

The UUPSUpgradable contract needs to have an added function called transferTo (it is missing in v5.x) 
And an extra parameter has been removed when _upgradeToAndCallUUPS is called (removed boolean false)
